Information about the code:
+ Each script file includes code for the analyses or plots indicated. 
+ All scripts contain additional information about analyses in comments throughout, with general meta-data about the file in the header of the script.




Information about the data:
+ All of the above data files are called into their respective R script files, with many data files being called into multiple script files.
+ Data was obtained from collections of age-0 Pacific Cod captured near Kodiak Island during 2007, 2009, 2010, 2012-2019 - see manuscript for details. 
+ Details about data formatting and variable names are below.
